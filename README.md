This project uses a linear regression model to predict diabetes progression based on the scikit-learn Diabetes dataset.

## Requirements
scikit-learn
seaborn
matplotlib

## Output
Prints the model's coefficients, intercept, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score.
Displays a scatter plot of predicted vs actual values.


## Code
The script performs the following steps:
1.Loads the Diabetes dataset.
2.Splits the data into training and test sets.
3.Trains a linear regression model.
4.Evaluates the model.
5.Visualizes the results.
